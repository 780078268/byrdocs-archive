[中文](README.md) | English

**byrdocs** is an educational resource sharing platform within Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (referred to as "BUPT" hereafter), aimed at making it easier for students to access resources related to BUPT courses, including e-books, exam questions, and revision materials.

At present, the P2P version and the web version share the same resource library, allowing users to choose the access method that best suits their needs.

## Important Notice

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This project is exclusively for BUPT students.** If you are not a student of BUPT, we reserve the right to cease providing services to you.

> [!NOTE]  
> **Please do not request resources in Issues.** We currently do not have the capacity to handle a large volume of resource requests.


## P2P Version

The P2P version distributes content via the [BitTorrent (BT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) protocol. You can download the necessary files using the seed file [byrdocs.torrent](byrdocs.torrent).

Using BT has a certain threshold, please ensure you are familiar with its operations. If you have any problems using BT, please search the internet for information, as we do not provide consultations on the use of BT.

### File Inquiry

**If you are looking for specific types of materials, please first download [metadata.ods](metadata.ods) and search for the relevant files.** Once you find the needed materials, note their MD5 value, and then download the corresponding files via BT.

### Download Instructions

You can download all files via a BT client; some clients (like qBittorrent) support selective downloading.

If you have sufficient local storage space (approximately 13GiB needed) and wish to support this project, we recommend downloading all files to seed.

## Web Version

The web version is currently under development, with a preliminary version expected to be released within half a month. Please be patient.
